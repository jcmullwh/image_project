Analysis

What we learned (portable rules)
A) Preference guardrails must beat “random concept”

If “dystopia/post-apocalyptic” is selected but the user dislikes apocalyptic + ominous, you either:

reject/replace the concept, or

translate it into safe forms (geometry, symbolism, repurposed design language) and ban “ruin/trauma” language.

B) Avoid “sadness vocabulary” when the target is “uplifting serenity”

Words like haunted, survivors, oppressive, shouted orders, scars will drag tone down almost every time.

C) “Clean” requires explicit clean-material language

If you want not dirty, don’t merely omit dirt—actively specify:

polished stone / clean ceramic / glossy glass

clear water / sparkling reflections

well-maintained / pristine / immaculate
(And avoid patina, weathering, grain, cracks.)

D) “Majestic/grand” can come from scale + symmetry, not decay

We can keep the monumental basin + towering architecture and still make it joyful. Scale ≠ oppression.

Concretely: where we went wrong in one sentence

We tried to satisfy “dystopia/post-apocalyptic” by leaning on oppressive history + trauma mood + weathered materials, which conflicts with the user’s “bright, vibrant, safe, clean secret garden” preference—so the model faithfully produced something that reads depressing and dirty.

Quick “next time” fix checklist

Ban-list (if aiming upbeat/clean): haunted, survivors, oppressive, shouted orders, scars, cracks, patina, weathering, concrete grain, dark pools, vignette.

Replace with bright/clean cues: polished stone, clear luminous water, sparkling frost, warm lantern-glow, thriving garden, joyful calm.

Keep dystopia only as design archaeology, not mood: “once-formal civic geometry now softened into a welcoming garden court” (no trauma words).
