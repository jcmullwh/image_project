11 harbor of quiet defiance - too simple. Two different colors.

19 - kinda cute but kinda weird

It doesn't make sense. It just looks like a real photograph it's not whimsical or fantastical

14 aqueduct - I like this one. It looks like it's something we'd go out and do.

I don't like it. A little too realistic and too dark and depressing.

I don't like this style of one side is x other side is y and couple is just inbetween. Also just random symbolism - it's weird.

10 terrace. Two sides, couple in middle. The style I don't like.

I like this one. 

Pink blue contrast two contrasting sides I don't like. I don't dislike it as much because it could actuallyt make sense but same thing

3 fading neon cartography - a bit dull with not a lot of visual interest to look at. I don't really like things that are mostly cityscapes.
