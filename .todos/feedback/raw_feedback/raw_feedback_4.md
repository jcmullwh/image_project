The image is like an ocean scene with a fancy city in the back. I really like the colors and the general scenery, I don't like how the couple are just randomly slotted into this corner. 

This image is like some sort of pool of water that goes into a lake. I like it a lot I don't like well, I like the scenery but I don't like the text on the screen again. I don't like how there's random arms randomly and I don't like how the couple is just like pasted there like they're a sticker. 

This one is like Japanese City with a koi pond. I actually really like this one. I think this is perfect.

This one is like some sort of plant garden. Oh it's radiant glass conservatory. I really don't like the lubin area Libra sign and generally I don't like text on the picture but everything else I really like.

 this one is forbidden sky weaving. The random cut off arms is horrible and again the couple is just kind of pasted at the back, I kind of wish they were Central instead of an afterthought. 

This one has weird numbers on the path and but otherwise it's very beautiful. I like it. This one is symmetric orchid library escape
