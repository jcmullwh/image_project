#024 harbor mirror health. Why is there a broken cup and cell phone? Why is there random coins and stuff on a lake it makes no sense.


Christmas tree Japan. This is nice.


#021 winter harbor threshold. This one is okay


#025 solstice harbor game. There's too much going on. The people in the front kind of distract actually. I like the background. Okay I get that it thinks I only like pink and blue but I like other colors too


#023 pier of unloved journeys I don't like this one because the two people are just awkwardly in the Middle with no legs and also the composition has issues with the left and right side again and overall I'd rather have nobody in the picture at all and just to appreciate the landscape than have two people who don't look like us randomly in the middle or in the back.


#026 Neon winter rooftop. I like this generally, but I don't like the two people in the front. Maybe it'd be interesting if they were aliens.
