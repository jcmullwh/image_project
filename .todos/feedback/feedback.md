1) #020 Signal Garden Sanctuary: Seems depressing and dirty.

2) #017 Cracked Ornament Runway - this looks like an add for liptick. I don't like that.

3) #011 harbor of quiet defiance - too simple. Two different colors.

4) #019 Prism-Warmed Winter Vigil - kinda cute but kinda weird

"20251221_003443_8848ed1c-0d0f-40ff-9317-3d938a1ebe35_transcript.json"

It doesn't make sense. Also it just looks like a real photograph it's not whimsical or fantastical

5) #014 aqueduct - I like this one. It looks like it's something we'd go out and do.

6) #015 Winter Tidepool Spiral - I don't like it. A little too realistic and too dark and depressing.

7) #018 - Starbridge Winter Keepsake - I don't like this style of one side is x other side is y and couple is just inbetween. Also just random symbolism - it's weird.

8) #010 terrace. Two sides, couple in middle. The style I don't like.

9) #004 Lighthouse of New Shores - I like this one.

10) #011 Harbor of Quiet Defiance - Pink blue contrast two contrasting sides (city village) I don't like. 
"20251220_130620_ea7b81d0-88ac-4675-bc70-93104d763ee0_oplog.log"

11) #016 Neon Sleigh Arc - I don't dislike it as much because it could actually make sense but same thing
"20251220_195730_079204f5-980d-420a-8494-1c5ff25e0b37_oplog.log"
"20251220_195730_079204f5-980d-420a-8494-1c5ff25e0b37_transcript.json"

12) #003 fading neon cartography - a bit dull with not a lot of visual interest to look at. I don't really like things that are mostly cityscapes.
