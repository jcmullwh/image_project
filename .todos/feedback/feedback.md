1) #020 Signal Garden Sanctuary: Seems depressing and dirty.

2) #017 Cracked Ornament Runway - this looks like an add for liptick. I don't like that.

3) #011 harbor of quiet defiance - too simple. Two different colors. I don't like the style it uses a lot where it's one thing on the left, a different thing on the right and the couple in middle.

4) #019 Prism-Warmed Winter Vigil - kinda cute but kinda weird

5) #014 aqueduct - I like this one. It looks like it's something we'd go out and do.

6) #015 Winter Tidepool Spiral - I don't like it. A little too realistic and too dark and depressing.
"20251220_191540_98c86bb3-dce5-454b-8411-839bb51e7eb3_oplog.log"
"20251220_191540_98c86bb3-dce5-454b-8411-839bb51e7eb3_transcript.json"

7) #018 - Starbridge Winter Keepsake - I don't like this style of one side is x other side is y and couple is just inbetween. Also just random symbolism - it's weird.
"20251220_221625_0eb46ca0-aa03-4ab2-a400-fafdde0cc19a_oplog.log"
"20251220_221625_0eb46ca0-aa03-4ab2-a400-fafdde0cc19a_transcript.json"

8) #010 terrace. Two sides, couple in middle. The style I don't like.

9) #004 Lighthouse of New Shores - I like this one.

10) #011 Harbor of Quiet Defiance - Pink blue contrast two contrasting sides (city village) I don't like. 
"20251220_130620_ea7b81d0-88ac-4675-bc70-93104d763ee0_oplog.log"

11) #016 Neon Sleigh Arc - I don't dislike it as much because it could actually make sense but same thing
"20251220_195730_079204f5-980d-420a-8494-1c5ff25e0b37_oplog.log"

12) #003 fading neon cartography - a bit dull with not a lot of visual interest to look at. I don't really like things that are mostly cityscapes.

13) #024 Harbor Mirror Hearth - Why is there a broken cup and cell phone? Why is there random coins and stuff on a lake it makes no sense.

14) #022 Quantum Winter Terrace - This is nice.

15) #021 Winter Harbor Threshold - This one is okay

16) #025 Solstice Harbor Game - There's too much going on. The people in the front kind of distract actually. I like the background. Okay I get that it thinks I only like pink and blue but I like other colors too

17) #023 Pier Of Unlived Journeys - I don't like this one because the two people are just awkwardly in the Middle with no legs and also the composition has issues with the left and right side again and overall I'd rather have nobody in the picture at all and just to appreciate the landscape than have two people who don't look like us randomly in the middle or in the back.

18) #026 Neon Winter Rooftop - I like this generally, but I don't like the two people in the front. Maybe it'd be interesting if they were aliens.
