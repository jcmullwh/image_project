Would be good to make the config location configurable

*** add a config for generation and upscaling that handles both aspect ratio and pixels. (16:9 specifically)


add conditionals (when observed - x image, y time)


add an Anki-style cooldown based on how confident we are.


Modify the idea input number AND/OR make it better at integrating (maybe explicitly forbid one side x other side y)

Make likes/dislikes inform concept selection

Opportunities:

Improve like/dislike




Add a like/dislike gradient (love to hate)

add an Anki-style cooldown based on how confident we are.
