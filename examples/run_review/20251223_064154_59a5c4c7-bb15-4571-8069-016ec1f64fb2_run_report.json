in the midground a warm, cross-cultural woman\u2013woman couple stands together, full-body visible, bundled in softly textured winter coats and scarves in harmonizing colors (charcoal, deep teal, soft coral accents), they stand close, holding hands at the pond edge, gazing down in quiet wonder, their elongated reflections mingling with the koi\u2019s luminous trails in ice and water, faces calm and gently joyful, the scene hums with quiet, electric anticipation, as if the pond itself is thinking, the koi\u2019s constellations feel like a language on the verge of meaning, inviting contemplation without offering answers, bioluminescent glow painting pink-purple-blue highlights onto snow and stone, tiny drifting snowflakes not obscuring the pond, sky a pale winter gold-to-soft-blue gradient

and enigmatic light artwork\n\n## Consensus 2\nsunny winter courtyard in luminous late-afternoon golden hour, bright optimistic lighting, no moody twilight, no heavy shadows, no gray haze, stylized digital illustration with smooth gradients and glassy reflective surfaces, a calm enclosed Japanese-inspired secret garden courtyard viewed from a slightly elevated three-quarter angle, environment-first focus, the scene built around a long shallow rectangular koi pond running horizontally through the center, its surface lightly dusted with fine snow and delicate ice, some sections frozen into translucent glass, others still liquid and crystal clear, beneath the surface enormous elegant koi drift slowly, their bodies softly bioluminescent, leaving prismatic neon trails in cyan, teal, magenta, lime, soft fuchsia blending smoothly, interweaving into luminous constellations that feel like a language on the verge of meaning, inviting contemplation without offering answers, the water pure and luminous with sparkling reflections, courtyard in cool slate grays, muted stone, snowy whites with clean polished stone and ceramic tiles, low zen-inspired stone borders, minimal, uncluttered, future-glossy gallery vibe, vibrant saturated yet harmonious palette, no monochrome, no flat muted tones, on the left a single tall evergreen in a white minimalist planter, deep forest green branches dusted with snow, decorated with just a few warm amber fairy lights and a softly curved, subtly shaded bold red ribbon looping like a restrained YBA installation, its sculptural line cutting a deliberate, almost provocative arc through the calm without becoming a hard split-color band, its warm glow reflecting in the ice, turning the tree into a quiet Christmas focal point, a faint warm halo from the lights softening the cold stone and turning the courtyard into a private Christmas sanctuary, on the right a clean-lined glass gallery wall with subtle reflections and a soft interior golden wash, framing the pond as a living artwork, composition balanced and gently asymmetrical: pond centered as a strong horizontal band, tree offset left, gallery wall right, an S-curve of glowing koi trails leading the eye inward, subtle secret-garden feeling despite the minimalist architecture, in the midground at the near edge of the pond a warm cross-cultural woman\u2013woman couple stands full-body visible, bundled in softly textured winter coats and scarves in harmonizing colors (charcoal, deep teal, soft coral accents), they stand close holding hands at the pond edge, gazing down in quiet wonder, their elongated reflections mingling with the koi\u2019s luminous trails, expressions calm, joyful, and serene, bioluminescent light painting pink\u2013purple\u2013blue highlights across the snow and stone, tiny drifting snowflakes visible but not obscuring the pond, above, a pale winter gold-to-soft-blue sky glowing over the courtyard walls, rich painterly detail, atmosphere serene and inviting, quietly enigmatic, the scene humming with quiet electric anticipation as if the pond itself is thinking, a refined YBA-inspired Christmas installation that is both living garden and enigmatic bioluminescent light artwork, mildly impressionist / animated-film still aesthetic\n\n## Consensus 3\nsunny winter courtyard in luminous late-afternoon golden hour, bright
